Hey tell, old man, had we a cause
When Moscow, razed by fire, once was
        Given up to Frenchman's blow?
Old-timers talk about some frays,
And they remember well those days!
With cause all Russia fashions lays
        About Borodino!

Yea, were there men when I was young,
Whose songs your tribe is not to 've sung:
        They'd fight, – you 're none as good!
An evil lot have they been drawn:
Few left the grounds to which they had gone...
Had it not been God's will alone,
        Old Moscow should have stood!

Retreating this day and the next,
We wonder'd when 's our battle, vext;
        The veterans talk'd upset:
"What then? we 're off to winter dorms?
Go the commanders by new norms;
Daren't they rip foreign uniforms
        On Russian bayonet?"

And then we had come upon a plain:
Here 's room to fight with might and main!
        There built we a redoubt.
Our troops are curt on high alert!
Soon as sun's beams on cannon spurt,
And on the bluish wood-tops squirt –
        The Frenchmen march right out.
